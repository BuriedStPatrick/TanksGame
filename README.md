# TanksGame
A local 2-Player Tanks-game based in Unity

## History
This was made by following an excellent tutorial TANKS! from Unite 2015 in Boston.
Playlist of the tutorials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnVXXoSDxXV4zsAsEyY86N4mYODSJ0a6b

I polished and cleaned some of the code, reducing a lot of the heavy duty functions and refactored in accordance with my own (ReSharper's) naming conventions.
Other than that, mostly the same.

## Assets
If you simply want the assets and try for yourself, you can find them for free on the Unity asset store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/46209
